This folder contains code to replicate the experiments on the yeast dataset in Section 5 of the main paper. The files it contains are:

- yeast.table, the raw data from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast

- yeast_experiment.py,  which runs the main experiment on the yeast data and generates the file result_df_full_trials_10000.pkl

- yeast_plots.ipynb, which generates Tables 1 and 3 and Figure 4 in the paper 

- eli_comp.ipynb, which compares our method to the method of Ben-Michael et al. '21, and generates Table 2 in the paper
